I know this might sound crazy enough to a lot you guys but let me make this clear right before I get along with this idea of mine. This is my first post on here so I want to make this a little bit less awkward for myself and then to you guys. Before You think any better reason for why I would revel my idea in here I want you guys to know that I am not a contained person, I myself am a walking idea bank. As an open person I often do tell my friends about the things we could make to make world better or make some money quickly(You know what I am talking about). As I said, all the ideas with specific tags I would mention in here (my portfolio site) is kind of open source in its own way. I will be posting my ideas that I am currently developing with the LICENSE and will be having a tag of `licensed-thoughts` to make all you guys understand that its not a free one like others. All the posts that has a tag of `free-thoughts` are free thinkings that I had and I would love people to be inspired in some or the other way to move on with their own way to do things off track. Ohh yeah you could always contact me through all the channels given in the bottom of the page.

Enough with all the big talks so what hell was my topic for this post?? Oh yeah ...

## Cloths that needs no washing !!!

I am not jocking guys, I have been wanting this to be produced so badly due to some reasons, in which almost all of them could be associated with my laziness.Here is how the idea goes inside my mind ..You should have at least 3 things to get this thing working ..

1. **Cloths**
1. **Absorbent**
1. **Ironing device**

You maybe kind of getting the idea already ,but anyway .. The cloths that you use should be made out of a cool new material which could break the bonds created with the external stuffs ( including all the dirt ) but rather than removing the dirt in normal conditions of weather and temperature acting as a repellent in normal use of the cloth ( this material already exist I think ) we need this new material to be in working mode as a repellent when temperature is applied to it. Thus at normal conditions of temperature and whether the cloth absorbs all the dirt and when the temperature raises above a certain level , lets say in the order of 100â„ƒ the dirt's attached with the cloths will start to loose the bond strength and will either evaporate or move down as a liquid and right here we need the absorbent to absorb all the dirt associated with the cloth when the liquid dirt try to move down the cloth. The absorbent that I am talking about in here should also be made very carefully so that its perfectly adapting itself at this temperature. The absorbent as of for now in my mind is a paper just like the one used for filtration inside water purifiers.

I know making all these things that I have talked about in here is very different and hard to achieve but heiii as I told u before its just another idea that I have in my mind. And there it goes everyone, that's all about the idea that I had in my mind, I hope you guys got motivated in someway or the other...
