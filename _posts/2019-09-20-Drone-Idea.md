I was in trip around India for the past 2 weeks and we as a class representing the computer science department batch 2017-2021 had went to a few fun giving destinations in India like the Golden Temple [Amritsir], Manali [Himachal Pradesh],Wagah Border [Punjab], Kasol [Himachal Pradesh], Delhi etc.. After the tour my friend Mathew was looking over the photos that he had in his collection and in there he was curious about a perticular picture that we had took from the Wagah Border. He was thinking how the hell did devassi got up there to take that photo up from there. There is a building in the Wagah Border where the indians sit to watch the army dealing with the border and the pic was taken from the top most part of that building and none of us had gone there as we were moving in group. This was the time that I had this crazy Idea in mind to lie and make my friend believe, I told him that the pic was taken using a drone which was being rented by some people outside the building and they take hourly charges for the drone.Ohh yeeeah I know that not everybody knows how to fly a drone but heiii my friend brought it and I had this frkn laugh at him, at the same time thinking well thats actually not a bad idea...

Waga Border India !!

So here is the idea in short, I have seen people giving services to other adventurous people by lending them vehicles and charging on it on hourly basis, and we already have people using the " go pro " and " drones " for shooting adventurous rides and things and if this is the case then why don't people try renting these devices??... I know it's a topic for a debate but hei I am pretty sure that If we were going to provides this devices with written assurances from the people who would want these devices in places where the demand for these devices is high then local people could be making a good amount of money. 360deg photos and videos taken through drones would be something to offer for sure!!. We could also provide the service to the people by ourselves by helping them to take the videos and picture using devices... At the end of the day always remember "Heiii Its just another idea"....
